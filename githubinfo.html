            <h2>Git/GitHub Terms</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Repository:A repository is a location where all the files for a particular project are stored, usually abbreviated to "repo." It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub or another online host.</li>
            <li><Commit:A commit is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you save a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "commit ID") that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who.</li>
            <li>Fork: A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.</li>
            <li>Push:Pushing refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository, such as a repository hosted on GitHub. Essentially, it's a way to upload your local changes to the server.</li>
            <li>Pull Requests: Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. They are a way to tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.</li>
            <li>Workflows:In the context of GitHub, workflows are automated processes that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any code project on GitHub.</li>
            <li>Issues:Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. They act as a kind of to-do list but integrated with your Git workflow.</li>
            <li>Raw Button:The raw button on GitHub allows you to view the plain text of a file as it is stored in the repository, without any formatting or interpretation by GitHub.</li>
            <li>Blame Button:The blame button on GitHub is used to see who last modified each line of a file and what commit the modification was made in. It's a powerful tool for tracking changes and accountability.</li>
